Introduction：<br>

<br>

　　There are usually many farmers selling their agricultural products in
the country side of Taiwan.
&nbsp;Someday I just passed by this place and stopped
in&nbsp;front of
the cage. &nbsp;There was a chicken which would be slaughtered
stuck
his head out from the cage and gazed at me. &nbsp;Suddenly I
remind&nbsp;a series of images which is related to the stray dogs
that
would be died in euthanasia. &nbsp;And&nbsp;some words which
are no
sense came into my mind at the same time, like "You do not kill the
stray dogs but the chickens die because of you.", "Stray dogs shouldn't
be killed but the chicken could&nbsp;die for its fate.", "Death
could
be as light as a feather or as heavy as a mountain."
&nbsp;Meanwhile I
had some faint feeling that there might be&nbsp;association between
the
sense of the messy thoughts at this moment and the&nbsp;recent
series
of creations&nbsp;of mine in theme. &nbsp;So&nbsp;risking
the
possibility of being expelled, I picked up the camera quickly and press
the shutter.<br>

<br>

　　I goole it after arriving home then I found the article - "<a href="http://stn.eslite.com/Article.aspx?id=834" target="_blank">生
殤相：流浪犬安樂死日最終肖像</a>" which was shot by "<a href="http://stn.eslite.com/ArticleByAuthor.aspx?id=327620" target="_blank">杜韻飛</a>" who is an author on <a href="http://stn.eslite.com/ArticleByType.aspx?id=A4" target="_blank">Eslite Station</a>.
&nbsp;I was very impressive when I saw these images first time.
&nbsp;The helpless and innocent faces on the stray dogs reflex to
the&nbsp;situation they're going to be and touch the reader deeply.
&nbsp;Someone may even rise his mercy of stray animals.
&nbsp;But just
below the same sky, some&nbsp;other groups of animal are also
facing a
similar situation like these stray dogs, maybe&nbsp;even worse.
&nbsp;To these chickens, for example, I don't think they will be
treated in euthanasia after the moment.&nbsp; Mostly they'll just
touched by the knife on their neck, and then waiting to die slowly.
&nbsp;I'm not challenging the issue whether the stray dogs should
be
&#8203;&#8203;euthanasia, captured or not. &nbsp;I just had
some&nbsp;strange
feelings of the contrast between the images of those stray dogs that
would be died in euthanasia, and the chicken which stuck
his head out from the cage and gazed at me. &nbsp;There are so many
concepts seem contradictory but parallel. And they all still exist
simultaneously in human world. &nbsp;Some animal conservation
organizations may fight for the death of the stray dogs. &nbsp;But
will
vegetarian or religious organizations fight for the chicken?
&nbsp;Does
the weight of different being could be distinguished? &nbsp;Should
the
care and protection of beings be different just because of the
different position of human? &nbsp;If beings can be divided into
levels, how will human put our self and face the beings that are more
advanced form someday? &nbsp;After organizing the thoughts caused
by
the gazing in that moment, I identified the concepts which could be
alternative or isomorphese in it.&nbsp; And the concept is the
theme
of&nbsp;creations which I've been focusing on recently, so I put it
as
an introduction of this text.<br>

　　The picture should be the starting point of this series of creations.
&nbsp;When this photo was taken, the relationship between each
other
was almost entirely separated just like the present in
picture.&nbsp;
The original situation should be under the same roof has been divided
into two different windows slowly because of the changing in half
year.&nbsp; The last connection between each other is subtle and
fragile
just like the dead branches in foreground.&nbsp; When will it break
and
separate completely?&nbsp; The initiative has been lost from Author.<br>

The world in mirror is an alternative but isomorphic structure to the
real world.&nbsp; Even if it's reversed around, it doesn't matter
for
the upcoming split hyperbolic intersection.<br>

It's pure and simple farmland landscape in one side and some modern
steel and concrete buildings in other side.&nbsp; Someone will turn
left and someone will turn right at this junction.&nbsp; It may
seem
contradictory but actually the scene is included all in the city
landscape which the radius isn't more than a hundred meter.<br>

The underground channels in Taipei Main Station are more easily
accessible.&nbsp; People shuttle here&nbsp;are moving away to
their
own direction busily every day.&nbsp; Station maintenance and
management
staffs decorate a photo layout elaborately on a side wall.&nbsp;
But I
think there are just a few people could stop and appreciate it
carefully.&nbsp; Photographs are the crystal which is carrying time
and
space.&nbsp; They represent a piece of space-time for the past, so
it could be also understood as an isomorphic structure of certain
period of
real space-time.&nbsp; It's a main pillar of the building which is
very smooth and reflective in front of the photo layout, so it reflects
an mirror image of the exhibiting photo.&nbsp; The passing traveler
walks in the hurry, but meanwhile his current figure mirror on the
smooth surface of the pillar with the photo which congeals the
space-time for the past.&nbsp; So the contrast of old and new
space-time images is integrated into another isomorphic structure.<br>
