&nbsp; 2011.10.18, it's the day both belong to connecting and
disconnecting. A frustrated man had been wandering and shooting these
photos in one month at his hometown - "Tainan" every night. Photography
is the only one salvation in these sleepless nights at all.<br>

2011.10.18 White Chicken<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 1st night. I went to a temple festival. I didn't
know
why there
was
a fearless white chicken standing in front of the stage
which will commence shortly. He is not afraid of people and has been
close to me. It seems like that he want to give me some consolation
silently.<br>

2011.10.19 Game4 of 2011 CPBL Taiwan Series<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 2nd night. Game4 of 2011 CPBL Taiwan Series was
played in Tainan tonight. I bought a ticket and try to put all the
unpleasant aside temporarily. I picked up a telephoto lens and caught
this image. "Chin-Feng, Chen - Brother Feng", who is a Taiwanese
baseball spiritual leader in decade, was twisted and pushed out of
batter's box by the close ball pitched by Uni-President starting
pitcher "Yi-Chen, Chen".<br>

2011.10.20 Game5 of 2011 CPBL Taiwan Series<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 3rd night. I went to Tainan Municipal Baseball
Stadium
again. The
home team of Tainan - Uni-President 7-11 Lions beat the Lamigo Monkeys
by 10:6 and won the championship of CPBL 22nd year - 2011(All photos of
"<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/elf0724/sets/72157627942236428/" target="_blank">CPBL 2011 Taiwan Series - Game 4 &amp; 5</a>"
on my flickr). I'm a Lions
fans since the first year of CPBL in Taiwan, but over the years, I has
never participated
in casting ribbons when the team win the championship. I
was not supposed to be staying in Taiwan tonight but accidentally it's
my first
time to witness Uni-President 7-11 Lions win the champion. Maybe this
world would like to tell me that no matter how bad the situation is,
something good will still happens. The most important thing is never
give up, keep doing your best! I know that I'll never forget this night
all
my life.<br>

2011.10.21 County Deity<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 4th night. I went to "Temple of Tainan County Deity"
tonight. In the traditional belief, County Deity is a Mayor or
Magistrate of local government
in charge of the underworld. County Deity is also in charge of the
judgment on good and evil, justice, reward and punishment
to human
being and ghost. The County Deity would neither wrong the innocence nor
let the guilt go. Ｗish the County Deity could
have all good and evil beings just the way they should be.<br>

2011.10.23 Garden Night Market<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 6th night. &nbsp;I've taken picture in Tainan famous
night market - "Garden Night Market". I was interesting in
strolling
around the night market when I was a child. But I don't feel
like to go to night market after 25 years old because it's so crowded.
The changing of my behavior should be the symbol
that I'm getting into middle-aged.<br>

2011.10.24 Dusk of Salt Pan<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 7th night. Just want to immerse myself in photography.<br>

2011.10.25 Exit<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 8th night. Actually it's dawn in the day, another
sleepless night. I rode my motorcycle speedy on Chia-Nan plain at night
and wanted to find somewhere to exit for my mind.<br>

<br>

2011.10.26 Carrefour<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 9th night. I went to buy something here with
my family last night, we didn't come here for a long time.
Strolling around the supermarket is a kind of entertainment
when we were in the most difficult situation. We especially love this
store because it opens 24 hours. No matter how late you stay
here, you won't have to worry about the store closes and you can feel
free to stroll around it by your own step. Now, the most
difficult situation had been passed. Life has come in here
and now. What will be harder to pass?<br>

2011.10.27 Homeless Guy<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 10th night. Actually it's dawn in the day again. I
couldn't fall asleep so went out to take some pictures. This homeless
guy
who has whole world as his home slept so well.<br>

2011.10.28 Orderly Disorder<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 11st night. Disorderly wires seem like the state of my
mood in this period. The beautiful sunset glow which captured by camera
is the salvation gave by photography. It's ugly in every place, but
also a beautiful side there. For my hometown, I would be to appreciate
its beautiful side earnestly.<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 12nd night. It's before dawn in the day. AM2:00,
strolled
around Tainan
City with my motorcycle in midnight. Just wanted to shoot something
what I saw and
felt interesting.<br>

<br>

2011.10.30 "Flowers in a Mirror, Moon in the Water"<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 13rd night. I've been used to take pictures in the
sleepless midnight. There is an idiom in Chinese - "Flowers in a
mirror, moon in the
water". It's used to describe something which is empty and unrealistic.
Life can be a long or a short time. If you don't want to sigh for that
all your life is just empty or "Flowers in a mirror, moon in the
water", you should make your part to be done well and prepare yourself
certainly on the road of life. <br>

2011.10.31 Swallow Lake Reflection<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 14th night. "Autumn Moon &amp; Swallow Lake" is the
famous
landscape of Tainan City. Although the moon couldn't be saw tonight.
The reflection of the Swallow Lake is still very attractive.<br>

<br>

2011.11.01 Anping Fish Market<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 15th night. November has come. I went to "Anping Fish
Market"(<a href="Project4fishEng.html" target="_blank">Theme4 Anping Fish Market</a>) in
another sleepless night at am2:00. It's a wholesale fish
market where the fishing boats unload their fishing attains directly.
Fishers and fishmongers trade with each other busily from am12:00~6:00
every day. If you don't feel like to sleep at midnight in Tainan, you
may consider buying some aquatic products home in this market.<br>

2011.11.02 Dark<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 16th night. Went out at am1:30. It's about the time the
night market getting closed. There was messy garbage all around. The
night market staff had to clean it out before morning coming. It would
be back to normal in daytime. So let's just hide the ugly side into the
dark.<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

2011.11.03 Fake Depraved Ladder<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 17th night. It was the original library of "National
Cheng Kung University"(NCKU) when I've studied in senior high school.
It becomes a common reading room now. I went out around the city in
this sleepless midnight. I've shot the picture of it but came to take
picture again in the evening. I think the color of sky is more
attractive at dusk. When rode through here, I remembered that I was
very attracted toward the campus life of NCKU during my senior high
school times. But NCKU is one of top university in Taiwan, so I never
had the chance to become a student of it. I went to university in
Taipei after graduated from high school. The University was named "The
College of Law and Business, National Chung Hsing University". It
restructured into the present "National Taipei University"(NTPU) after
I graduated from the university one year later. The school was located
in downtown of Taipei City. The area of school land was quite small, so
there was no campus life at all. I finally had normal campus
life until I went to the graduate school in "National Chengchi
University"(NCCU).
It reminded me some memories of life in NCCU when I passed here before
dawn accidentally. I didn't go to the campus of NCCU too often because
of the
different state of my mind form a university student to
a postgraduate student, but sometime I would still stroll
around it at night.
The ladder of the NCKU original library reminded me that there was a
similar but much higher ladder in front of the NCCU library. I would
sit and rest on the ladder for a while when felt tired after stroll
around the campus of NCCU at night. The life of student times
really leads
me to endless aftertastes.<br>

2011.11.05 "Song-Zih-Jiao" BBQ seafood restaurant<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 19th night. My sister and her husband came back to
Tainan
this weekend. We went to have dinner at "Song-Zih-Jiao" which is the
famous BBQ
seafood restaurant of Tainan. It's the very typical lifestyle of
Taiwanese folk with the slight breeze and open-air street food booth in
front of the temple square.<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 20th night. My sister and her husband asked me to bring
them
to Anping Fish Market. So I went to here with my family in midnight
again. It's really interesting that you can see such a variety of fish
species in midnight.<br>

2011.11.07 Yellow Light<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 21st night. Standing at a crossroads at this moment.
It's
neither the green light you can pass through, nor the red light to be
able to stop. It's just the yellow light in the middle which is
hesitant. Where can I find the salvation?<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 22nd night. Rode pass through the "Former Julius Mannich
Merchant House(Former German Julius Mannich &amp; CO.)" - a
third-grade historic site of Tainan - in evening. This international
conference was being held - Visual Communications Image
Processing(VCIP)2011. The scholars on stage introduced themselves are
from Japan, Korea, Germany, and USA...etc, and the audience
participants should be from more different countries. It's very
creative to hold an international seminar in front of the
centuries-old Tainan historic site(All photos of "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/elf0724/collections/72157627134870511/" target="_blank">Tainan Historic Sites</a>" on my

unique style
- Roadside Banquets.<br>

2011.11.09 Night Scene of Tainan Confucius Temple<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 23rd night. It has been raining for several days. We
don't
have too much rain in Tainan during this season. I went to Tainan
Confucius Temple(All photos of "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/elf0724/sets/72157627259196466/" target="_blank">Tainan Confucius Temple</a>" on my
flickr) tonight. As many people know, Tainan is the primary
city of Taiwan, so it owns the most number of cultural property and
historic sites in Taiwan. Tainan Confucius Temple is the most
representative of them. It is the first Confucian Temple built on
Taiwan in AD 1715 and has become to be known as Foremost School in all
Taiwan. Thereafter, Taiwan entered into the period of civilization,
thus
Tainan Confucius Temple is very meaningful in the history of Taiwan.
Author has been shooting pictures of Tainan historic sites in the
past few years. When review the shots, I found I shot most pictures
here. But I have never taken pictures of Tainan Confucius Temple in the
rainy night, so I came to here to shoot the night scene of Tainan
Confucius Temple in a rarely rainy day. It really feels different while
comparing to the usually shots.<br>

2011.11.10 Rainy Night<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 24th night. Rain has never stopped from last night.
Whole
city seemed to be soaked in water. I went to take picture in the
evening. The building in the photo is "National Museum of Taiwanese
Literature"(All photos of "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/elf0724/sets/72157627134915635/" target="_blank">National Museum of Taiwanese Literature</a>"
on my flickr). It was the "Former Tainan City Hall" which remained from
Japanese occupation era. It's the imitation of Baroque architecture
which was designed and built by Japanese. And it's also "Minsheng Green
Garden" traffic
circle here. Motorcyclists were wearing colorful raincoats in a rainy

2011.11.11 Night Scene of Chihkan Tower<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 25th night. It's "Chihkan Tower"(All photos of "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/elf0724/sets/72157627134890463/" target="_blank">Chihkan Tower</a>" on my flickr) which
is also the historic
site
author take pictures frequently. Chihkan Tower was built in AD 1653 by
the Dutch people and was named "Provintia". The main function of it was
the administrative center at that time. The original building has been
destroyed due to age-old. The building we can see now was built by
Japanese during the Japanese occupation era. After the period of
colonial Dutch government on Formosa(now known as Taiwan), pro-Ming
Dynasty state(also known as "The Kingdom of Tungning"), Qing Dynasty
rule, Japanese occupation era and even the "Republic of China -
Taiwan"(not the "People's Republic of China") today,
Tainan has always been the origin and center of Taiwan's multi-culture.
To live in Tainan is so lucky that there are a lot of historic
sites to shoot.<br>

2011.11.12 Blue Moonlit Night<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 26th night. It's about am5:00. I couldn't fall asleep
all
the night so went out to take pictures in the dawn. And I found it was
full moon in this night. Although the sky was still cloudy, but the
moon shined its bright and clear moonlight from the clouds gap between
whiles. Thus I had a beautiful blue moonlit night before the sunrise.<br>

2011.11.13 Take me out to far away<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 27th night. In the dark. Would like to be took out to
somewhere
far away by the light flow on the railway.<br>

2011.11.14 Night Scene of Anping Old Fort<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 28th night. It's "Anping Old Fort"(All photos of "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/elf0724/sets/72157627259214054/" target="_blank">Chihkan Tower</a>"
on my flickr). It was also built in AD 1624 by the Dutch people and was
named "Zeelandia". The original building has been destroyed, too. But
the incomplete wall you can see in front of the picture is the
historical remains. And the spire architecture right behind it in the
picture was built by Japanese during the Japanese occupation era. I
came to take picture here this afternoon and suddenly it's becoming
dusk. Thus I took the night scene of it.

2011.11.15 Temple Festival of Taiwanese Traditional Religious Ritual<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 29th night. There are many temples in Tainan proceeding
"Taiwanese Traditional Religious Ritual Events" recently so the
traditional lanterns are all around the city. I pretty liked this kind
of makeshift construction with the colorful decorations and actively
dolls in my childhood. But it is usually removed in a short time, so I
have to grasp the opportunity to take picture for it.<br>

2011.11.16 Here Comes the Dawn<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 30th night. It was the liveliest areas of Tainan. And it's
still
a good place for many people shopping around here now. I've shot the
picture here with motion picture film before but can't help to shot
with a digital camera again. Advances in technology have brought us
many conveniences. Handheld shooting becomes easier due to the pure
quality of high ISO of digital camera. And the grain of film is still
gentle and mild. Film and Digital photography both has their
advantageous position when comparing to each other.<br>

2011.11.17 Merry Christmas<br>

<br>

&nbsp; 31st night. Suddenly, department stores began to put out
their Christmas tree. So it will be Christmas Day after one more month.
Time has passed so fast, the year will be end instantly. Hope everyone
can have the best wishes in such a wonderful Christmas Day. Merry
Christmas.<br>

&nbsp; To shoot night scene in Tainan for one month
uninterruptedly,
this theme can be considered as temporary close. I had not planned
particularly about the works this time in advance, just been shooting
randomly
depends on my own memories and feeling of this city every day. Although
it may be lack of intension, but they are author's outside
self-projection to this real world during the period. Of
course, there are
always many endless story and landscape to be shot in a city. All the
beautiful or ugly side could not be present completely. Therefore, I'll
keep shooting in the future.<br>

<br>

&nbsp; The beginning of this theme was the unpleasant emotion. To
face
it, I could just help myself to pass the tough time
through photography. Perhaps I'm somewhat comforted by the
process of producing
the graphic and article, or maybe just the time healed and smoothed
down
the feeling of my heart. I still not feel so well,
but I think it will get better slowly. Hope I can keep the creative
energy in future, but do not have negative emotions anymore.<br>
