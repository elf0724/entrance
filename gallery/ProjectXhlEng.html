&nbsp; &nbsp; There was an article published by San Francisco
Chronicle on May 8,
2011 which is named "<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/05/06/TR0E1IVPJM.DTL&amp;type=travel" target="_blank">Exploring Tainan, Taiwan's hometown - Spud
Hilton, Chronicle Travel Editor, Sunday, May 8, 2011, San Francisco
Chronicle</a>". It introduced Tainan as a historical
city
in Taiwan. Mr. Spud
Hilton who is the editor of San Francisco
Chronicle concluded all in one words that "History
and tradition here, it seemed, are not meant just for
watching." after his personal traveling in Tainan.&nbsp; In my
hometown - Tainan, history is not just for watching but
really presented as an inheritance in our daily
life. It obvious that people retained many traditional customs of local
life from everywhere you can see to all festivals. And through the
vision of a foreign news editor who had been traveled here personally
and seen the lifestyle of local people, I believe it could reflect the
fact in certain degree of objectivity from the conclusion which was
wrote by him.<br>

<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Since I entered the field of photography, the
historic sites of
Tainan are the main subject I've been
shot. In the process of photo taking, I've&nbsp;accumulated
some observation of the interaction between the historic sites and
people live in Tainan in few
years. Compared to the attitude that retaining or isolating historic
sites
rigidly just because of fearing of the damage to
them, It's very lively in the preservation and application of historic
sites whether in government or private
areas. It can be said that the life of people in Tainan is inseparable
from historic
sites, and not only that, it could even be a very close
combination. You can see the ordinary folk blend in with the historic
sites harmony in food, clothing, housing, transportation, education,
joy and so on in the life of general
people. The author will present images which were
captured based on the realization described above in this article,
and&nbsp;the topic of it is "Historical Life".<br>
