&nbsp; I've been using Olympus 4/3 E-System DSLR E-510 since the middle
of 2007.&nbsp; As an Olympus camera user, I've been so used to take
pictures with my stuff.&nbsp; But in the end of 2011, there was an
accident which caused my E-510 to stop working.&nbsp; Instead of
repairing it, I bought an E-400 from ebay and had been waiting for the
new flagship from Olympus until this year.<br>

      <br>



&nbsp; Comparing to the 4/3 system, the M4/3 system has been greatly
improved to the next step.&nbsp; The amazing E-M5 appeared in 2012,
thanks to the new technology, it's fantastic in almost every aspect.
The only remaining problem for old Olympus users is the focusing speed
for the original 4/3 system lenses.<br>







      <br>



&nbsp; When E-M5 launched, Olympus made it clear that it was not the
top model of M4/3 system OM-D series.&nbsp; After about one year, E-M1,
the M4/3 system camera which effectively enhances the 4/3 system lens
focusing speed, was released.&nbsp; It makes the 4/3 system lens focus
effectively through the phase detection focus on the sensor.&nbsp; In
the end, Olympus has lit up the road for the future of 4/3 System
lenses.<br>

&nbsp; For people who are fascinated with 4/3 system lenses, there are
not too many options.&nbsp; The E-M1, equipped with so many new
technologies, seems to be the only choice.&nbsp; I received my
pre-ordered E-M1 with kit lens on the last day of October.&nbsp; My
first impression of the camera is quite good. It's slightly smaller
than E-510 but the grip is still acceptable. On the whole, it's a lean
and compact camera which suits to my personal preferences.&nbsp; I
couldn't wait to take photos with it and took it to "Taipei Baoan
Temple" at that night.&nbsp; With 5-axis anti-shake technology and
progressive high ISO, the results is quite awesome and so different
from the old 4/3 system camera body.<br>

      <br>



&nbsp; Photography is my hobby.&nbsp; I'm not a full-time photographer,
so I only have very limited time to take photos.&nbsp; To get familiar
with E-M1 as soon as possible, I took it with me everyday during the
whole November.&nbsp; As a flagship in the entire system, the handling
is much better than my old E-510.&nbsp; You can change the settings by
the dual wheel and lever quickly, without entering the menu.&nbsp; It's
a very different experience for me because this is my first time to
have a flagship camera.&nbsp; The button size on E-M1 is
moderate.&nbsp; I think Olympus should has noticed the criticism on
E-M5 and made an adjustment.&nbsp; The body and grip are both smaller
than E-510 but not a big problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; It feels very solid to
grab in hand. If the E-M1 was smaller, it will be more difficult to
handle.<br>





      <br>



&nbsp; By the way, E-M1 is my first camera with a flip-screen.&nbsp;
It's very convenient for me to take some photos that I would give up
due to the troublesome angle in past.&nbsp; I think it's also a plus on
camera handling.<br>

      <big style="font-weight: bold;">Adapting to the 4/3 System
Lens</big><br>







      <br>



&nbsp; Unlike E-M5, which simulated the traditional SLR, the E-M1 has
moved back to the DSLR exterior design.&nbsp; The most obvious
difference is the larger grip helps user to grab the camera better when
equipped with 4/3 system lenses.&nbsp; I have four 4/3 system lenses in
hand.&nbsp; They are ZD 9-18mm F4-5.6&#12289;ZD 12-60mm F2.8-4 SWD&#12289;ZD 50-200mm
F2.8-3.5 SWD and ZD 50mm F2 Macro.&nbsp; These lenses were reborn while
the E-M1 came out to this world and I really look forward to seeing
their performance on E-M1.<br>







      <br>







      <big style="font-weight: bold;">Focusing Speed</big><br>







      <br>



&nbsp; The most notable aspect of adapting to the 4/3 system lens on
E-M1 is focusing speed.&nbsp; Comparing to the M4/3 camera body before
E-M1, it's been improved a lot.&nbsp; You guys can see the footages
about the real performance of&ldquo;E-M1 and 4/3 system lens&rdquo;on
internet like youtube.&nbsp; According to the footages, the focusing
speed of 4/3 system lens on E-M1 is slightly slower but much better in
accuracy than the previous flagship E-5.&nbsp; The focusing speed of
4/3 system lens on E-M1 has qualified for me since I have a very
limited experience on using 4/3 system camera body. I have just had
used E510 &amp; E-400, and never used E-30&#12289;E-3 or E-5. But I must say
that I shoot mostly in slow speed.&nbsp; For someone who wants to take
pictures on high speed or dynamic motion by E-M1 and 4/3 system lens,
it might be more challenging for them.<br>







      <br>







      <big style="font-weight: bold;">Image Quality</big><br>







      <br>



&nbsp; Another feature of E-M1 is the sensor without the low-pass
filter.&nbsp; To shoot with the 4/3 system lens, the image quality of
E-M1 is quite awesome.&nbsp; The color management is also very
"Olympus", bright and vivid.&nbsp; The pictures from E-M1 and 4/3
system lens even make you feel more clear overall.&nbsp; The crystal
feeling is really outstanding compared to the E-510 with Panasonic
LiveMOS or the E-400 with Kodak CCD.<br>







      <br>



&nbsp; &nbsp;It is worth mentioning that some users found the
performance of long exposure at low ISO on E-M1 is worse than
E-M5.&nbsp; For me, I have been satisfied with the result of the long
exposure at low ISO by E-M1.&nbsp; Since the long exposure in low light
environment has never been the strength of 4/3, M4/3 system, I don't
argue on this part.&nbsp; To accept it or not, I think it depends on
the judgment by individual user.<br>

      <big style="font-weight: bold;">Convenience</big><br>







      <br>



&nbsp; Opposite to the low ISO, the usage of high ISO of E-M1 is
another concern.&nbsp; According to the result tested by some websites
and users, I limited the highest auto-ISO to ISO3200.&nbsp; When the
light condition is adequate in the daytime, the lower ISO can help
reach the shutter speed requirements and provide fine image
quality.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, when I need to shoot at night
and pull up ISO to 3200, the result is still good enough and above
average.&nbsp; I believe it's very convenient for everyone to take
pictures in many situations in daily life.<br>

      <big style="font-weight: bold;">Other improvement</big><br>







      <br>



&nbsp; For a user who shifted from E-510/E-400 to E-M1, the improvement
is very significant.&nbsp; The auto white balance is quite smart.&nbsp;
5-axis anti-shake technique is very powerful and helpful.&nbsp; The
bright electronic viewfinder allows users to frame conveniently and
comfortably.&nbsp; Electronic level is useful when you need to keep
horizontal.&nbsp; The Live time function could redefine long exposure
experience completely.&nbsp; The wifi remote control also inspires you
with more creative shooting techniques.&nbsp; These all are the
advantages of E-M1.<br>

      <big style="font-weight: bold;">Photos shot by 4/3 system
lens</big><br>







      <br>







&nbsp; E-M1 is definitely in the top position of M4/3
system.&nbsp;
However, there is a more important question that could it inherit the
entire 4/3 system lens group smoothly?&nbsp; What will these lenses
elaborate on E-M1?&nbsp; Could it also be served as a 4/3 system
flagship?&nbsp; We got to know it.&nbsp; And here I'll provide
my point
of view after&nbsp;had been using my four 4/3 system lenses on E-M1 during a month.<br>







      <br>

      <big style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">ZD
9-18mm F4-5.6</big><br>







      <br>




&nbsp; ZD 9-18mm F4-5.6 is a standard grade ZD lens.&nbsp; Its
performance on 4/3 system camera is satisfactory.&nbsp; It's a
light
and handy wide-angle lens.&nbsp; You won't feel too much weight
when taking it with you.&nbsp; Thus it's one of my favorite
lenses.&nbsp; The wide-angle perspective stays the same when attached on E-M1.&nbsp;
But the image quality of the corners slide down very
obviously.&nbsp;
It's a serious problem and very different from the original 4/3
system.&nbsp; The image area not so far from the center has become blurry
when aperture is fully open.&nbsp; The improvement is limited even
downgrade to
F8.&nbsp; It's acceptable when downgrade to F16.&nbsp; But the
overall
quality is not as good as F8 due to the diffraction
phenomenon.&nbsp;
Considering the image degradation of the corners, I mainly used this
lens in F16.&nbsp; Therefore, it would be better to use it during a
sunny day or on a tripod.&nbsp; If you happened to have this lens
and
would like to try to shoot some wide-angle pictures.&nbsp; Maybe
it's
not a bad idea to use it on E-M1.<br>

50mm F2 Macro</big><br>







      <br>

&nbsp; ZD 50mm F2 Macro is a High Grade ZD lens, but it's
considered
to be a Super High Grade lenses by many 4/3 system users because of its
superior performance.&nbsp; The soft and beautiful bokeh is also a
great feature.&nbsp; In the past, the focusing speed of ZD 50mm F2
Macro was quite
slow on 4/3 system cameras, but it becomes so fast on E-M1.&nbsp;
Very
impressive!&nbsp; I guess it may be the contribution of its F2.0
large
aperture.&nbsp; The performance of ZD 50mm F2
Macro
adapting&nbsp;on E-M1 is the best of my four 4/3 System lenses.&nbsp;
The
result shot by this lens is great and the image quality in corners
doesn't drop even the aperture is fully open.&nbsp; Actually
I
didn't use this lens on E510 or E-400 too much.&nbsp; So its
performance on E-M1 is a surprise just like a whole new world for me.<br>

      <br>







&nbsp; ZD 12-60mm F2.8-4 SWD also belong to the High Grade
lens.&nbsp; Actually, I almost gave up testing it on
E-M1.&nbsp; The
reason is quite simple.&nbsp; I found the overall
performance
of M.ZD 12-40mm F2.8 is better than what I thought.&nbsp; When I
got my
E-M1 lens KIT, I took some pictures with M.ZD 12-40mm F2.8.&nbsp;
The
image quality is excellent and it's really a compact and light
lens.&nbsp; Furthermore, the focusing speed of native M4/3 system
lenses on E-M1 is better than 4/3 system lenses after all.&nbsp;
These
are the good reasons to give up ZD 12-60mm F2.8-4 SWD.&nbsp; In
fact,
my plan of E-M1 pre-order was originally for the body.&nbsp; I was
wondering to adapt my ZD 12-60mm F2.8-4 SWD on it, but finally I
decided to purchase the lens KIT.&nbsp; It was out of my plan and
this
case really gives me an unexpected surprise.<br>







      <br>




&nbsp; I still attach ZD 12-60mm F2.8-4 SWD to E-M1 to do the test
shot because the focal length of 12-60mm is 1/3 longer than
12-40mm.&nbsp; When you just want to mount a lens on E-M1, ZD
12-60mm
F2.8-4 SWD is a good choice.&nbsp; With the 2X digital
teleconverter on
E-M1, it will be a very a convenient travel lens.&nbsp; The
performance
of ZD 12-60mm F2.8-4 SWD on E-M1 is also good.&nbsp; The
focusing speed and accuracy are not bad.&nbsp; The image quality of
the
corners also slides down but the situation is better than ZD 9-18mm
F4-5.6.&nbsp; I suggest downgrad the aperture to at least&nbsp;F5.6 at
12mm, F8 at 60mm, and to improve the corner quality effectively.&nbsp; You don't have to worry about
it if
the corner was arranged to be&nbsp;part of bokeh.&nbsp; ZD 12-60mm
F2.8-4 SWD is no doubt a High Grade lens after all, the
central part of image is totally no problem.<br>

50-200mm F2.8-3.5 SWD<br>







      </big><br>

&nbsp; ZD 50-200mm F2.8-3.5 SWD is my favorite 4/3 system
lens.&nbsp;
As a High Grade lens, ZD 50-200mm F2.8-3.5 SWD&nbsp; is
better
than ZD 12-60mm F2.8-4 SWD in all aspects.&nbsp; Its image quality,
compact size, light weight, large aperture, reasonable price, all of
them is excellent.&nbsp; It's difficult to find another
comparable&nbsp;lens in other camera systems.&nbsp; I will say I can't
give up 4/3 system just for this
lens.<br>







      <br>







&nbsp; One of the telephoto lens characteristics is the narrow viewing
angle.&nbsp; The feel of compression can create some unusual visual
effects.&nbsp; There are lots of photos that touched my heart were shot
by my
ZD 50-200mm F2.8-3.5 SWD and E-510.&nbsp; Thus I was also very
concerned
about its performance when adapting to E-M1.&nbsp; I've&nbsp;been assured&nbsp;the
answer by actually using it.&nbsp; The result shot by this lens on
E-M1
is even better than the old 4/3 system camera.&nbsp; The image quality
of
corners slides down very mildly.&nbsp; I used to fix the aperture at
F4.&nbsp; There's no big problem about the corner image quality at F4.&nbsp; Furthermore, the overall image
quality&nbsp;is greatly improved due to the substantial evolution of
E-M1.&nbsp; I
believe it's&nbsp;good news for people who love this lens.<br>

      <big style="font-weight: bold;">The timing to use art
filter</big><br>







      <br>







&nbsp; Olympus equipped the art filters on camera starting from the 4/3
system
E-30&nbsp;to all M4/3 system cameras.&nbsp; These filter
effects&nbsp;add more fun to enrich&nbsp;user experience.&nbsp; E-M1 is certainly no exception.&nbsp; In order to
understand
the real performance of ZD lenses, I shot pictures in normal mode
during this period of adapting 4/3 system lenses on E-M1.&nbsp; But
sometimes I just can't help to please myself by using these art
filters.&nbsp; It really makes me happy, and I have some suggestion
after doing so.&nbsp; Using these art filters usually causes the
loss
of details.&nbsp; Therefore, the timing to use them
should
be considered carefully.&nbsp; Despite the loss of some details, if one can
enhance his pictures by using these art filters it would
be appropriate.<br>

      <br>







&nbsp; Actually, I wrote a conclusion with my native language, but
it's too complicated to translate into English because I made a
metaphor from ancient poetry.&nbsp; Thus, I could just make the conclusion as
briefly as I can here.<br>







      <br>

&nbsp; 4/3 system has always been a very capable tool to meet&nbsp;my
needs.&nbsp; But sometimes we can hear the criticism about the sensor
size by people who has never use it.&nbsp; Honestly, it
does matter, but not the whole part of a camera system.&nbsp; In
fact, there is not a perfect camera system&nbsp;in this world.&nbsp;
The
weaknesses of X system might be the strengths of Y system, and vice
versa..&nbsp; So
what we can do is to clarify our needs and&nbsp;understand the
advantages and disadvantages of different systems.&nbsp; Then we
can find the camera we really need.&nbsp; After that, all we
have to do is to maximize the strengths and avoid the weaknesses of
it.&nbsp; I believe the final results should not be too far from
what we want.<br>







      <br>







&nbsp; As a top camera body of 4/3 and M4/3 system, E-M1 is very
competent.&nbsp; I am very satisfied with it.&nbsp; For folks
who still have 4/3 System High Grade or Super High Grade lenses in
hand, will not regret to have an E-M1.&nbsp; It can
fully utilize your existing resources and let you see more
possibilities of ZD lens.&nbsp; If you're already a M4/3 system
user, "Is it worth upgrading to E-M1?" will be a matter of
debate.&nbsp; E-M1 is somewhat preparing for 4/3 system
lens.&nbsp; If you do not have 4/3 System High Grade or Super High
Grade lenses, maybe the E-M5 &amp; M4/3 system lens can be very
useful for you.&nbsp; I think "E-M5" or the "E-M1 MarkII"
are both good options unless you have a strong demand for fixed-grip
and some new features of E-M1.&nbsp; For someone who is totally new
to photography or would like to try another camera system, E-M1 is
certainly the best choice of 4/3 &amp; M4/3 system now, except its
price.&nbsp; Is it worth the price or not?&nbsp; It relates to
the subjective&nbsp;judgment by individual.&nbsp; I think the
answer should be reserved for the reader yourself.&nbsp; :)<br>
